## List of Colors
A list of colors that can be used with `d3.scaleOrdinal()`.
The benefit is that it gives you more colors than stuff like `d3.schemeTableau10`.

```javascript
const colors = [
  "#8dd3c7",
  "#bebada",
  "#fb8072",
  "#80b1d3",
  "#fdb462",
  "#b3de69",
  "#fccde5",
  "#d9d9d9",
  "#bc80bd",
  "#ccebc5",
  "#ffed6f",
  "#1f78b4",
  "#33a02c",
  "#e31a1c",
  "#ff7f00",
  "#6a3d9a",
  "#b15928",
  "#a6cee3",
  "#b2df8a",
  "#fb9a99",
  "#fdbf6f",
];
```

**Note** that I simply used `Github Copilot` to generate these colors. They are not guaranteed to be optimal in terms of Color Theory.
