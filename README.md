# VisEngineering Guide

## Motivation

> _A lot of people candidly just don't have time for the front-end industries bullshit._\
> \-- Rich Harris (creator of Svelte)

This documentation is aiming to provide engineering best practices for `visualization researchers` , covering topics such as `d3.js`, Front-end Frameworks, and useful visualization libararies.&#x20;

(At this point, this documentation is only a  shared repository containing reusable codes snippets. We will continue to make progress.)

The documentation is open-source and we welcome any contribution!
